# 19 [COMMAND]
# List all services which are started at boot time and name this kind of services

	service --status-all
	I was unable to find consistent terminology for this kind of service, but some terms I saw used include: upstart services, startup services, startup daemons, and boot services. The first of these to run on startup is called init, which is the ancestor of all other processes.
